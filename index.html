					<p>
The Dalit and the caste system have existed for more than 2000 thousand years. It was the first instituted when the Aryans, from Iran, settled India around 1500 BC. There were always five castes, all with different roles in Indian society. Most of them represent a different body part of Brahma, the Hindu God of Creation:

<p>
The Dalit are at the bottom. The Dalit are even lower than the Shudras, the feet. They are not even a part of Brahma, but something wholly different than him. They are also called the Untouchables, as touching a Dalit person would make you impure just like they are. They are designated to doing difficult and degrading labor. The most famous of these occupations is the “street-cleaner”. These people pick up trash and feces from the streets for little pay.

<p>
The Dalit have historically been India’s none Aryan population. These people have lived in India long before the migrating Aryan population even reached the subcontinent. Most of the Dalit are from Southern India, and many of these people have darker skin than North Indians. However, not all Dalit people have darker skin than .

<p>
This divide between the Aryans and Southern Indians (ethnically known as the Dravidians) was exacerbated when the British began to carve up the India. They encouraged this social hierarchy. They made it more rigid to divide the Indian people and make them easier to rule.

<p>
After India won its independence in 1947, the Indian legislature tried to ban Dalit discrimination. In 1950 the Dalit caste was officially banned by the Indian government. However, discrimination towards Dalit people largely increased. The Prevention of Atrocities Act in 1989 was passed in order to crack down on the violence against Dalit. This law was made to prevent upper caste people from torturing and assaulting Dalit people. Still, the legislation remains just a piece of paper and is doing little to stop the descrimination and violcence.

Dalit people have been continuously oppressed by upper-caste individuals. Even in today’s day and age crimes against Dalit are commonplace. According to National Geographic, every two hours, a Dalit is assaulted. Every day, three Dalit women are raped, two are murdered, and two Dalit houses are burned down. In the year 2000, 25455 total crimes were committed towards Dalits. </p>

<p>
Alongside the violence, Dalits are often forced to take on large amounts of debt. This is because as a Dalit, it is very difficult to get a well-paying job. Because of this debt, many people have to sell their children into bonded labor. The majority of the 40 million slaves in India are Dalit, and 15 million of them are children. </p>

<p>
Most jobs Dalit people can get, even if they are not outright slavery, are very demeaning are difficult. Though many Dalits are street-cleaners, many are migrating farm laborers and prostitutes. Many of the migrating farm laborers have very little wealth because they constantly have to move to new locations. Most Dalit prostitutes are not only sexually abused, but are forced into the job even as young girls. </p>

<p>
Even though Dalit people have low wages, it is difficult for them to demand higher ones. Dalit people cannot form unions. This is because the government agency that you must use to legally form Unions, the Registrar of Cooperatives, does not work with illiterate people. Because most Dalits are illiterate, the agency won’t work with them. </p>

<p>
Dalit people often do not have access to education. 95% percent of illiterate Indians are Dalit. This illiteracy further reduces their societal power. Also, most Dalit face descrimination when trying to get a secondary education. In 2019, a Dalit student killed himself because of this descrimination towards him. He was not let into the school purely because of his caste. </p>

<p>
Healthcare is often restricted from Dalit people.  Dalits are denied access to hospitals and doctors. This greatly reduces their length and quality of life. In a survey from a predominantly Dalit village, 30-40% of a Dalit people said healthcare workers refused to visit the village. </p>


<p>
The most troubling of all this is that not only Dalit people are facing these human rights abuses, but they cannot report them. 68160 complaints were filed towards the police in the year 2000 but the police dismissed 62% of those complaints. </p>

				<div class="infoDiv" id="3id" style="display: none;">
					
					<p>Even though Dalits have been oppressed for thousands of years, there have been actions to stop this. As I have mentioned in the history section, the Indian government has passed many laws to stop this discrimination. Also, in 2002, the United Nations officially condemned caste discrimination. However, both the United Nations and the Indian Government have done little to prevent caste-based discrimination.</p>

<p>Throughout Indian history, there have been a few prominent Dalit rights activists. Most famously, B. R. Ambedkar, a prominent Indian politician, condemned the treatment of Dalit people. He was the bedrock of the anti-caste movement.</p>

<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQaq4j92uyDdm0WWd6_-iY5H14KYMvgNqsDJA&usqp=CAU">

<p>Most of the action against caste-based discrimination today come from NGOs. The most prominent of these organizations is the <a href=”https://idsn.org/”>International Dalit Solidarity Network (IDSN)</a>. This organization works globally to stop Dalit discrimination. This is the main voice in the Western World that advocates for Dalit rights.</p>

<p>To help put an end to this caste-based you could <a href=”https://idsn.org/donate/”>donate</a> to the IDSN. However, if you can’t donate to the organization, you could help spread the word yourself. The problem cannot be tackled unless if the public is conscious of it. Only then will lawmakers and other organizations put international pressure on India to further crackdown on caste-based discrimination. </p>
