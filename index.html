					<p>
The Dalit and the caste system have existed for more than 2000 thousand years. It was the first instituted when the Aryans, from Iran, settled in India around 1500 BC. There were always five castes, all with different roles in Indian society. They each represent a different body part of Brahma, the Hindu God of Creation:

<p>
The Dalit are at the bottom. They are also called the Untouchables, as touching a Dalit person would make you impure like them. They are designated to doing difficult and degrading labor. The most famous of these occupations is the “street-cleaner”. These people pick up trash and feces from the streets for little pay.

<p>
These Dalit people have historically been India’s none Aryan population. These are the people who have lived long before the migrating Aryan population. Most of these people are from Southern India, and many of these people have darker skin than the North Indian people. However, not all Dalit people have darker skin than Aryan people.

<p>
This divide between the Aryans and Southern Indians (the Dravidians) was exacerbated when the British began to carve up the subcontinent. They encouraged this social hierarchy. They made it more rigid to divide the Indian people and make them easier to rule.

<p>
After India won its independence in 1947, the Indian legislature tried to ban Dalit discrimination. In 1950 the Dalit caste was officially banned. However, Discrimination towards Dalit people continuously increased. The Prevention of Atrocities Act in 1989 was passed in order to crack down on the violence against Dalit. This law was made to prevent upper caste people from torturing and assaulting Dalit people.

Dalit people have been continuously oppressed by upper-caste individuals. Even in today’s day and age crimes against Dalit are commonplace. According to National Geographic, every two hours, a Dalit is assaulted. Every day three Dalit women are raped, two are murdered, and to Dalit, houses are burned down. In the year 2000, a total of 25455 crimes were committed towards Dalits. </p>

<p>
Alongside the violence, Dalits are often forced to take on large amounts of debt. This is because as a Dalit, it is very difficult to get a well-paying job. Because of this debt, many people have to sell their children into bonded labor. The majority of the 40 million slaves in India are Dalit, and 15 million of them are children. </p>

<p>
Most jobs Dalit people can get, even if they are not outright slavery, are very demeaning and hard. Though many Dalit is street-cleaners, many have to be migrating farm laborers and prostitutes. Many of the migrating farm laborers have very little wealth because they constantly have to move to new locations. Most Dalit prostitutes are not only just mentally abused, but are forced into the job even as young girls. </p>

<p>
Even though Dalit people have low wages, it is difficult for them to demand higher ones. Dalit people cannot form Unions. This is because the government agency that you must use to legally form Unions, the Registrar of Cooperatives, does not work with illiterate people. Because most Dalits are illiterate, the agency won’t work with them. </p>

<p>
Dalit people often do not get access to education. 95% percent of illiterate Indians are Dalit. This illiteracy further reduces their societal power. Also, most Dalit people are unable to seek out a secondary education. In 2019, a Dalit student killed himself because of the discrimination of the universities. He was not let in purely because of his caste.

<p>
Healthcare is often restricted from Dalit people. This greatly reduces their length and quality of life. Dalits are denied access to hospitals and doctors. In a survey from a predominantly Dalit village, 30-40% of a Dalit people said healthcare workers refused to visit the village. </p>



<p>
Most troubling of all this is that not only Dalit people are facing these human rights abuses, but they cannot report them. 68160 complaints were filed towards the police in 2000 but the police dismissed 62% of those complaints. </p>

				<h4 class="infoLabel" id="3il">How You Can Help Stop Discrimination: <b>Their Future</b></h4>
					
				<div class="infoDiv" id="3id" style="display: none;">
					
					<p>Even though Dalits have been oppressed for thousands of years, there have been actions to stop this. As I have mentioned in the history section, the Indian government has passed many laws to stop this discrimination. Also, in 2002, the United Nations officially condemned caste discrimination. However, both the United Nations and the Indian Government have done little to prevent caste discrimination.</p>

<p>Throughout Indian history, there have been a few prominent Dalit rights activists. Most famously B. R. Ambedkar, a prominent Indian politician, condemned the treatment of Dalit people. He was the bedrock of the anti-caste movement.</p>

<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQaq4j92uyDdm0WWd6_-iY5H14KYMvgNqsDJA&usqp=CAU">

<p>Most of the action against caste-based discrimination today come from NGOs. The most prominent of these organizations is the <a href=”https://idsn.org/”>International Dalit Solidarity Network (IDSN)</a>. This organization works globally to stop Dalit discrimination. This is the main voice in the Western World that advocates for Dalit rights.</p>

<p>To help put an end to this caste-based you could <a href=”https://idsn.org/donate/”>donate</a> to the IDSN. However, if you can’t donate to the organization, you could help spread the word yourself. The problem cannot be tackled unless if the public is conscious of it. Only then will lawmakers and other organizations put pressure on India to further crackdown on caste-based discrimination. </p>
